NAME
       git-lfs-fcgi - GIT LFS FastCGI Server


SYNOPSIS
       git-lfs-fcgi [--config=FILE]


DESCRIPTION
       git-lfs-fcgi is a FastCGI binary which implements the GIT LFS protocol.

       git-lfs-fcgi is best used when hosting GIT  repo  over  HTTPS  with  an
       existing webserver. This allows a webserver to manage both the GIT repo
       and LFS server under one URL and allows for clients to seamlessly inte-
       grate  with LFS support.  git-lfs-fcgi can run standalone, but the sup-
       port is not as good.

       A configuration file must be created  and  configured  before  use.  By
       default,  the  server will serve nothing. See conf/git-lfs-fcgi.conf in
       the source as a starting point for setting up the  configuration  file.
       This  file  should  be  created and saved to /etc/git-lfs-fcgi/git-lfs-
       fcgi.conf See git-lfs-fcgi.conf(5) for futher details.

       git-lfs-fcgi should be initially run as the root  user,	but  edit  the
       configuration  file  to	set  an unprivileged user and chroot path. The
       server will drop its root unprivilege and optionally chroot to  a  path
       after it has fully started.


OPTIONS
       git-lfs-fcgi  only  takes  one option. If no options are passed it will
       attempt to load the default configuration file.


       --config=file
	      Specifies the configuration file. The default  is  /etc/git-lfs-
	      fcgi/git-lfs-fcgi.conf.


FILES
       /etc/git-lfs-fcgi/git-lfs-fcgi.conf
	      The default configuration file used by git-lfs-fcgi. This can be
	      overridden by the --config option.  See git-lfs-fcgi.conf(5) for
	      futher details.
       /var/lib/git-lfs-fcgi/run/git-lfs-fcgi.sock
	      The  FastCGI  socket used by git-lfs-fcgi for communicating with
	      the webserver.
