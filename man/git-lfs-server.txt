NAME
       git-lfs-server - GIT LFS FastCGI Server


SYNOPSIS
       git-lfs-server [--config=FILE]


DESCRIPTION
       git-lfs-server  is a FastCGI binary which implements the GIT LFS proto-
       col.

       git-lfs-server is best used when hosting GIT repo over  HTTPS  with  an
       existing webserver. This allows a webserver to manage both the GIT repo
       and LFS server under one URL and allows for clients to seamlessly inte-
       grate  with  LFS  support.   git-lfs-server can run standalone, but the
       support is not as good.

       A configuration file must be created  and  configured  before  use.  By
       default, the server will serve nothing. See conf/git-lfs-server.conf in
       the source as a starting point for setting up the  configuration  file.
       This  file  should be created and saved to /etc/git-lfs-server/git-lfs-
       server.conf See git-lfs-server.conf(5) for futher details.

       git-lfs-server should be initially run as the root user, but  edit  the
       configuration  file  to	set  an unprivileged user and chroot path. The
       server will drop its root unprivilege and optionally chroot to  a  path
       after it has fully started.


OPTIONS
       git-lfs-server  only takes one option. If no options are passed it will
       attempt to load the default configuration file.


       --config=file
	      Specifies the configuration file. The default  is  /etc/git-lfs-
	      server/git-lfs-server.conf.


FILES
       /etc/git-lfs-server/git-lfs-server.conf
	      The  default configuration file used by git-lfs-server. This can
	      be  overridden   by   the   --config   option.	See   git-lfs-
	      server.conf(5) for futher details.
       /var/lib/git-lfs-server/run/git-lfs-server.sock
	      The FastCGI socket used by git-lfs-server for communicating with
	      the webserver.
