NAME
       git-lfs-server.conf - GIT LFS server configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       git-lfs-server.conf  is the main configuration file for git-lfs-server.
       It defines the global configuration values of the server as well as the
       configuration  to  one  or more GIT LFS repositories hosted on the same
       server.


FORMAT
       The format of the configuration file is a list of key value pairs.   In
       addition,  one  or  more  repository  blocks should be defined for each
       repository.

       The default configuation file is  located  at  /etc/git-lfs-server/git-
       lfs-server.conf

       An example configuration may look like this:


	      base_url "http://example.com"
	      chroot_path "/var/lib/git-lfs-server"
	      repo "My Git Repo"
	      {
		   uri "/myrepo/info/lfs"
		   root "/var/lib/git-lfs-server/myrepo"
	      }


       Continue  reading  the  following  sections for the meanings behind the
       settings.


GLOBAL SETTINGS
       These are settings that can be set globally in the configuration files.


       base_url URL
	      Mandatory. This should be set to the base URL of your webserver.
	      i.e. "https://git.mydomain.com" This will be the	URL  used  for
	      generating  download  and upload links for the Git LFS client to
	      upload and download objects.


       chroot_path PATH
	      Optional chroot path. All repository objects will only be  writ-
	      ten to subdirectories in this folder.


       user USER
	      System  username	to run the server. Default is: "git-lfs". Once
	      the server startup is complete, it  will	attempt  to  drop  its
	      privilege to this user.


       group GROUP
	      System group to run the server. Default is: "git-lfs".


       verify_upload [yes|no]
	      Whether uploaded files are verified by comparing the SHA256 with
	      the file contents before saving it.  Default is true.


       num_threads NUM
	      The number of worker threads to use. Increase to allow more con-
	      current connections.


       fastcgi_server [yes|no]
	      By  default,  the  server  is configured to run in FastCGI mode.
	      Optionally set this to no to run with  the  built-in  webserver.
	      You  must  also specify the port number if running as standaline
	      server.  Running as a standalone server is not recommended.


       port NUMBER
	      The port number to use to listen when  not  running  in  FastCGI
	      mode.


       fastcgi_socket PATH
	      Path to the unix domain socket to use for FastCGI communication.
	      This  path  must	start  with  /var/lib/git-lfs-server/run.   By
	      default,	this  is  set  to /var/lib/git-lfs-server/run/git-lfs-
	      socket.sock It is not recommended to change this.


       include PATH
	      Includes the specified path as part of the  configuration.  Sup-
	      poses wildcards *.


REPOSITORY SETTINGS
       In  addition to the global settings, one may define one or more reposi-
       tories. Each repository is defined using the repo block. The repo block
       looks like:


	      repo "Name of Repo"
	      {
		   uri "/repo/info/lfs"
		   root "/var/lib/git-lfs-server/repo"
		   # other settings ...
	      }


       For each repository, the following settings may be set.


       uri URI
	      Mandatory. Defines the URI for this repository. This is combined
	      with the base_url to make  a  fullpath.	For  example,  if  the
	      repository defines:

		   uri "/var/gitrepos/myrepo.git/info/lfs"

	      and in the global settings base_url is defined as:

		   base_url "https://www.example.com"

	      then  it will match the URL: "https://www.example.com/var/gitre-
	      pos/myrepo.git/info/lfs"


       root PATH
	      Mandatory. Defines a path in your filesystem to where  to  store
	      the  LFS	objects  for  this repository.	Initially, this should
	      point to an empty directory on your  filesystem.	The  directory
	      should  also  have write access to the "git-lfs" user, or which-
	      ever user was defined in the global configuration. IMPORTANT: if
	      the  chroot_path	was  defined in the global configuration, then
	      this directory must also start with the chroot_path.


       enable_authentication [yes|no]
	      This option is only necessary to enable built-in	authentication
	      when  running  as a standalone server. When running as a FastCGI
	      binary, it's better to let your webserver handle the authentica-
	      tion.


       auth_realm NAME
	      Authentication realm name. Optional.


       auth_file PATH
	      Only  used  when	enable_authentication is set to yes. Path to a
	      passwd file which contains credentials for users to access  this
	      repository.  The passwd file is created using the htpasswd util-
	      ity from Apache and only supports bcrypt passwords storage only.
